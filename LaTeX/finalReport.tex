\section{Related Work}
In today's world a lot of effort is made to make transportation as good as possible. For most countries and cities the road systems is a vital part of it's transportation system. With the ever growing population and increasing purchasing power of the public, good traffic control has never been as urgent. Changes to road systems are hard to make and drivers wouldn't be pleased if many experiments were made on live traffic. That's why traffic simulators play a big role in increasing the quality of the road system. Any change can be simulated and the result of the change can be analysed. There are many challenges that traffic simulation creators face. Trying to predict the behaviour of drivers and the synergistic effects of different factors can have on a driver behaviour is perhaps the most challenging, the goal is to make it as realistic as possible.\\

Many traffic simulators exist as well as many papers and books on that subject. In this module we were given two papers on traffic simulation for inspiration for this project and an insight into this field. Sewall, Wilkie, Merrell and Lin \cite{sewall2010continuum}presented a novel method for the synthesis and animation of realistic traffic flows on large-scale road networks. Their technique is based on a continuum model of traffic flow they extended to correctly handle lane changes and merges, as well as traffic behaviours due to changes in speed limit. They demonstrated how their method can be applied to the animation of many vehicles in a large-scale traffic network at interactive rates and showed that their method can simulate believable traffic flows on publicly available, real-world road data. They furthermore demonstrated the scalability of this technique on many-core systems.\\

Namekawa, F. Ueda, Hioki, Y. Ueda and Satoh \cite{namekawa2005general} spent several years developing a general purpose road-traffic simulation system to analyse road traffic jams. The concept of their system was using the running line model as opposed to fixed road-network information database, which is not effective in their opinion. Their simulator uses the a cell automaton model.

\subsection{Graphical User Interface}
In our application, JavaFX is selected as a graphic platform to be used. This platform allows developers to create an application on various platform such as desktop, mobile, or web. Furthermore, this platform introduce the use of cascading style sheets (CSS) to decorate the interface. This way, coders won’t have to worry about decorating the interface themselves in their codes and let CSS designer to handle this instead. Although in our application the use of this benefit haven’t been implemented along with the java code but we think that this is a very helpful technique worth mentioned from JavaFX.
Our application consists of 2 stages, which are both a top-level container of JavaFX, one is the main stage that will show a simulation and another one is the one used to show a simulation’s result. The first stage is separated into 2 parts by using Border pane. This pane works like BorderLayout in Javaswing but in JavaFX this layout is implemented into a pane rather than being one of the layout to be set into an empty pane. The followings are put into left and center region of this border pane respectively:
\subsubsection{Canvas}
Canvas is a node that is a blank image. This node can be painted on using GraphicsContext class object. Our canvas has a width of 800 pixels and height of 600 pixels so we don’t have to worry about how our application will run in different screen resolution since this dimension is probably comply with all present screen resolutions. To draw a simulation, we can call a GraphicsContext object from canvas itself using \texttt{getGraphicsContext2D()} and by doing so, we can manipulate the canvas with various methods from GraphicsContext like \texttt{fillPolygon(double[] X, double[] Y)} which will draw a polygon with specified fill colour from a set of coordinate X and Y. To draw roads, we can call an above method and get a set of parameters from a simulation class which contains a list of roads. Each road can provide its own coordinate at each corner so we use this as elements to be added into a set of X and Y coordinate. Because this is a “fill” type method which will also paint an enclosure of a polygon we can provide only 3 points to the method which these are \texttt{leftStartPoint},\texttt{leftEndPoint}, and \texttt{rightEndPoint}. The method automatically close the gap between a start point and last point with a straight line and fill a polygon afterwards. For vehicles, we have already provided a picture for each type of vehicle in a JPEG format and draw these pictures based on what type of vehicle we are dealing with from a list of vehicle provided from simulation class. There is a useful method in Vehicle class called \texttt{getDisplacementVector()}, using this method along with the one in Point class from utils package called \texttt{angleVectorDegree()} we obtain an angle in which a vehicle is running compare to a horizontal line measuring In counter-clockwise manner. After we obtained a value of angle, a method called \texttt{drawRotatedImage()} will do a job to draw a vehicle picture onto a canvas. This method, again, call another method \texttt{rotate()} which receive 4 parameters consist of GraphicsContext object, angle value, x-position, and y-position where these x and y form a coordinate in which will be an anchor point of the rotation. After that, we create a rotate class object by using above parameters. This rotate class object will perform a calculation in order to make a GraphicsContext rotate before we actually draw something using it. After we have rotated the GraphicsContext, we can normally draw a picture onto a canvas.
\subsubsection{Settings panel}
In this panel, we take an advantage from JavaFX features called HBox and VBox, which will place objects horizontally and vertically next to previous one by specified insets. The idea is to put many Hboxes into one VBox but since radio buttons still require us to put them in vertically, so we have put one VBox into Hbox to be able to put radio buttons in their correct position. Figure x given below will give an overall image of how we put each component together within this pane (HBox indicated by red border, VBox indicated by black border and object are indicated by blue green border).

\section{Team Work}
In this chapter we'll describe how we worked together during this project, including the tools and processes we used to facilitate group work. We'll will not reflect on what went wrong and what worked well, that is the focus of chapter 6 - Evaluation.
\subsection{Methodology}
A slightly adjusted Agile methodology was used for this project. What is meant be that is we did not follow Agile to the bone but we took bits and pieces from Agile that we knew from previous studies and work experience. The bits and pieces we chose to use from Agile are things that we believed would work for us in this project, i.e. iterations, user stories, roles and we used test driven development to some extend.
\subsubsection{Roles}
\textbf{Balázs Kiss:} Lead programmer\\
\textbf{Eddy Mukasa:} Architect \\
\textbf{Yukolthep Visessmit:} Graphical designer \\
\textbf{Pongsakorn N. Riyamongkol:} Project Manager \\
\textbf{Snorri Hannesson:} Tester and Coordinator \\ \newline
Each member of the group had a responsibility to oversee one aspect of the project but was not expected to do all the work defined in his role. I.e. each member should/could do some programming but the lead programmer should oversee the code and make sure nothing is missing and everything is done properly. The same goes for the other roles.

\subsection{Physical meetings}
Every Thursday at 10 o'clock we had a physical meetings where all team members were expected to attend. We kept log of our meetings so those who were unable to attend the meeting could get up to date by reading the log and for those who did attend the meeting to refresh their memory of what was discussed in the meeting.
In these meetings we discussed the progress we made from last meeting and the problems we were faced with. At the end of each meeting we allocated work to each member witch is supposed to be done during the week until next meeting.
Occasionally extra meetings have been scheduled where a certain aspect of the project been focused on. Not all members are expected to attend these meetings but only the members who are focusing on this certain aspect of the project.
\subsection{GitHub}
Github was used for version control. Our branching strategy was that every time a member wanted to implement a new feature to the system or write something to the report, a new branch was created for that feature. When that branch was created it would be up to date with the master. When work were done on that branch a pull request would be made to the master. The leader of that aspect of the project would then decide to merge or to create a new branch with suggestions of improvements or alterations. Those improvements could then be merged with the original branch which could then be merged with master.
\subsection{Facebook}
Facebook was used as a communication channel. The first thing this team did was to create a facebook group for the team. Most people these days use facebook everyday so this is very convenient communication channel. In this group we would have various discussions about the our progresses or problems. The facebook chat was also used for individual members to discuss matters that were not directly associated to the group as a whole but only the members in the chat.
\subsection{Trello}
Trello is a versatile tool which was used for project management. The rationale for using Trello is that it's very flexible so you can modify the interface to your will. In this project not all tasks were code related which is not a problem when using Trello. 


\newpage
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Evaluation: Critically evaluate your project: what worked well, and what didn’t? how did you do relative to your plan? what changes were the result of improved thinking and what changes were forced upon you? how did your team work together? etc. Note that you need to show that you understand the weaknesses in your work as well as its strengths. You may wish to identify relevant future work that could be done on your project.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Evaluation}

\newpage	
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Peer Assessment: In a simple table, allocate the 100 ‘points’ you are given to each team member. Valid values range from 0 to 100 inclusive. You may assign decimal values, but the entire points must add up to precisely 100.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Peer Assessment}

\indent\indent Robert T. \cite{roberts2006self} states that “The term peer assessment refers to the process of having the learners critically reflect upon, and perhaps suggest grades for, the learning of their peers.” In the other words, peer assessment is a process which student are able to assess their friends based on the criteria. This causes student to provide some feedbacks and evaluate their friends, which may help learning together (University of Reading, 2015). Therefore, TeamDiversity is going to use the peer assessment method for grading our member. This will be going to focus on the methodology which is used for assessment following by the criteria. It will be then shown the result and summary of each member in TeamDiversity. 
	\subsection{How do we evaluate our member?}
	
	\indent\indent I. Distribute the assessment form and assessment criteria to our member.\\
	\indent II. In each member, he/she must score himself/herself as well as other group member. For example, if our team has 4 people, it will grade 1 for yourself and 3 for our friends.\\
	\indent III. When you have completed a score (your friends and yourself), you need to mark total add up all scores and calculate the average score for yourself. \\
	\indent IV. We use only the average score to evaluate our friends and present in this report. 


	\subsection{What is the criteria that we have used?}
		\indent University of Sydney (2015) has published the assessment criteria and form on the website. TeamDiversity has adapted both documents in the appropriate way for supporting our task. This criteria is going to evaluate ten aspects of member behaviour. In each aspect, we have scored in the range from 0—10. Thus, the total marks of each member will vary from 0—100 inclusive. There will be then illustrated the detail in each aspect of peer assessment criteria, as followed \newline

\textbf{Project description}


\textbf{Background}
Over the past few decades, the world's population has been continuously increasing. This increase in population has resulted in overwhelming traffic which is becoming a serious problem in most major cities around the world. Cities like London, Bangkok, and New York are faced with serious traffic congestion challenges. To be able to handle these challenges and make the traffic run smoother many different traffic management policies have been tried. Before these policies can be implemented in the real world they are tested on traffic simulators. These simulator are supposed to be abstract models of the real world, so if a traffic management policy works on the simulator it probably works in the real world. In this module we will develop a traffic simulator.


\textbf{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] To develop a traffic simulator program which has the following structure: two types of vehicles, three types of drivers, functional road system with many roads and lanes, junctions, intersections and traffic lights.
\item[•] To compare two different traffic management policies: Fixed Time Policy and Congestion Control Policy.
\item[•] To examine how the system reacts in a time of emergency by injecting an ambulance to the simulator.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scale}
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Each road can have multiple lanes, which can be in the same or opposite direction.
\item[•] As in Britain the traffic is left-lane oriented.
\item[•] The system will have cars and buses.
\item[•] Driver behaviour can be cautious, reckless, or normal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outline}
\begin{description}
\item[Description]:
The traffic simulator is an abstract model of actual real world traffic. The simulator will have both cars and buses. Drivers' behaviour can be cautious, reckless or normal. Two different traffic management policies will be implemented witch are supposed to relief traffic congestion issues. The two policies are fixed time policy and congestion control policy. These policies can be compared by average time each vehicle is in the system. Moreover, an emergency strategy will be implemented to see how the system reacts when an ambulance is injected to the system. 
\newline
The simulator will be programmed in Java programming language. The simulator will have a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is created with the help of JavaFX software platform. The rational for using a GUI: 1. Better visualisation and understanding of code during development, i.e. actually seeing what is happening when programming collision detection. 2. When the final product is ready users can see the road system and the cars and therefore get a better understanding of how the road system is and how the policies work. Opposed to just get the result log and results of which policy is superior and have no visual understanding of what happened. 
\item[General Concept]:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1. ]\underline{Vehicle Types}: There are two types of vehicles: cars and buses. Cars go faster and have higher acceleration than buses. The shape and size of the bus is bigger than car, so it takes more space on the road.
		
		\item[2. ] \underline{Driver Behaviour}: The drivers can behave in three different ways: cautious, reckless, and normal. Reckless drivers drive faster than normal but the cautious drivers drive slower than normal. Reckless drivers are more prone to change lanes and overtake other vehicles, if a fast vehicle is stuck behind a slow vehicle the fast vehicle will try to overtake the slow vehicle.

		\item[3. ] \underline{Emergency Strategy}: When an ambulance is injected to the system it gets highest priority. That means that cars on the right lane will change to the left lane if possible to free the right lane for the ambulance. Also, the ambulance gets to pass at the intersection first.

		\item[4. ] \underline{Traffic Management Policy}: There are two different traffic management policies; \textit{Fixed Time policy} and \textit{Congestion Control policy}:

		\begin{description}
		\item The \textbf{Fixed Time Policy} will have peak hours (when the traffic density is the highest) and off-peak hours (when the traffic density is normal). On peak hours will the duration of the green light be longer than on off-peak hours.
		\item The \textbf{Congestion Control Policy} will always have the same duration of green light in each direction unless the system detects a congestion. When a congestion is detected in some direction the duration of the green light will be increased in that direction for one time to avoid traffic jam. \\
		\end{description}
		
The two different policies will be compared by average time each vehicle is in the system. Each vehicle will have a timer that starts when it enters the system and gets written to a log when the vehicle exits the system. The average time that a vehicle is in the system is calculated and the the policy that generates lower average time is considered better.
		 		
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\textbf{Schedule}

The time period is divided into three iterations and then the tasks allocated to the iterations. Each task is either mandatory or optional for the simulator:

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\textbf{Expectation of Project Outcome}
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] The traffic simulator is developed and implemented.
\item[•] Results showing which traffic management policy is superior or if they are equal.
\item[•] The simulator can be used in case of emergency.
 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Current progress}
We are currently finished with iteration 1 and we are on schedule. We have implemented the roads, lanes that can go in the same or opposite direction, different vehicles and different drivers' behaviour. However, we are still trying to find the best architecture for the different drivers' behaviour and vehicles. \\
As the name of the team implies; we are a very diversified group. From four different countries in three different continents, each with different programming background and experience. Although some of the members of the team were familiar with git and GitHub, LaTeX and some of the other technical tools we are using, some team members weren't. For everyone in the team to be able to make an contribution we have spent a quite a lot of time discussing those technical tools. \\
The biggest challenge so far is to get everyone on the same page about the project and the tools used for developing and collaboration.

%	PART TWO
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\textbf{Project organisation}
\textbf{Project management}
A slightly adjusted Agile Methodology is used for this project. We have divided the time period for this course into iterations and at the end of each iteration we want to be inching forward towards the final product.

\textbf{Roles}


\textbf{Balázs Kiss:} Lead programmer \\
\textbf{Eddy Mukasa:} Architect \\
\textbf{Yukolthep Visessmit:} Graphical designer \\
\textbf{Pongsakorn N. Riyamongkol:} Project Manager \\
\textbf{Snorri Hannesson:} Tester and Coordinator \\ \newline
Each member of the group has a responsibility to oversee one aspect of the project but is not expected to do all the work defined in his role. I.e. each member should/could do some programming but the lead programmer should oversee the code and make sure nothing is missing and everything is done properly. The same goes for the other roles.

\textbf{Collaboration}
We have physical meeting every Thursday at 10 o'clock. We have a log of all meetings. Other means of collaborations are:
\newline \\
\textbf{Facebook} is used as a communication channel. \\
\textbf{GitHub} is used for version control. \\
\textbf{Trello} is used for project management.


\textbf{Peer Assessment and Self Assessment}
Team members should evaluate their own and other members' performance regarding work done in the group. This can be
done by using an assessment form where every member secretly grades themselves and other members of the team. Then can contributions to
\textbf{GitHub} and \textbf{Trello} be examined for evaluation of members performance.

\textbf{Conflicts}
If we have a conflict during this project the will have democracy; the majority decides. However, if a major conflict arises we will have to contact the instructor to resolve the conflict. We have defined a simple method to resolve conflicts: 
\newline
\textbf{I.} Realise conflict. \\
\textbf{II.} Handle conflict sooner rather than later. \\
\textbf{III.} Find the solution together - democracy. \\
\textbf{IV.} Apologise. \\
\textbf{V.} Appreciate. \\
