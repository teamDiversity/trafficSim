\section{9th of February}
We went over the initial report as a whole and made a few minor changes. Neab suggested a more rigorous timetable which is something we should consider for the final report.

We discusses what should be in the presentation. We decided to start with a short overview of the initial report, then show a class diagram and a use case diagram. And finish with a demo of the program. Neab was going to finish the presentation but he needed the diagrams from Eddy and was going to contact Gabb to get the first prototype running on his computer. Neab was going to check if the presentation works on his computer with in the room where the presentation is held.

We also discussed a better implementation of the cars and buses and drivers. Where we would have a different drivers class. Eddy was going to push a suggestion of improvement to some branch on github (I think).

\section{5th of February}
We discussed the resent additions we had made on the simulator, multiple vehicles and the GUI. The drives should have different behaviour, reckless driver on a bus or a car but not reckless car and a reckless bus.

Then we discusses the initial report and read the initial report handout. We decided to go with Mandatory/Optional table with 3 or 4 iterations. We discussed what our objectives were for this project.

We discussed whether we should have presentation slides and decided to have two slides, one would be the summary of the initial report and the other would be a UML diagram. We decided to meet on Monday 9th of feb to finish the initial report and presentation.

\section{29th of January 2015}
\begin{itemize}
\item We discussed the the structure of the initial report and then revised the progress so far on the initial report. We discussed in particular what role each member should have, what project management style we should use and strategy.
\item We decided to use Trello for task management.
\item Roles: Bálazs - (lead) programmer, Gabb - (lead) graphical designer, Eddy - (lead) software architect, Neab - Project manager and Snorri - (lead) tester. So each member would supervise his sector of the project; for instance Eddy could make some unit test bench but Snorri would oversee all the tests and make sure that everything would be tested, etc.
\item We discussed some branching strategies on github. 
\end{itemize}

\section{21st of January 2015}
We discussed more technical aspects of the implementation; what classes we would create and their interrelation, what GUI platform we would use, how we would implement tests and when to start the test phase and if one of us should have the role of a tester, what IDE is nice, how Github works, ect. We decided that we would use a project management style built on iterations, start with building a simple prototype and try move closer towards the final product in each iteration. Finally we allocated work among ourselves unit next meeting:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Everyone:} Think about how to implement the project.

\item \textbf{Balázs:} Creating a project and making the first lines of code and put on Github.

\item \textbf{Eddy:} Creating a first draft of a UML diagram.

\item \textbf{Gabb and Neab:} Familiarise themselves with Github and GUI implementation with JavaFX.

\item \textbf{Snorri:} Write meeting log, and start the initial report.

\end{itemize}

\section{15th of January 2015}
The project was introduced and the group was formed and we exchanged basic information about ourselves. We decided that we would use Java and discussed the time of next meeting. And decided that we would meet every Thursday at 10 o'clock.
